              React Router, and dynamic, client-side routing, allows us to build
              a single-page web application with navigation without the page
              refreshing as the user navigates. React Router uses component
              structure to call components, which display the appropriate
              information. By preventing a page refresh, and using Router or
              Link, which is explained in more depth below, the flash of a white
              screen or blank page is prevented. This is one increasingly common
              way of having a more seamless user experience. React router also
              allows the user to utilize browser functionality like the back
              button and the refresh page while maintaining the correct view of
              the application.

              The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively
              produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the
              alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to
              child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier,
              lighter approach to state management using Redux.
              React.createContext() is all you need. It returns a consumer and a
              provider. Provider is a component that as it's names suggests
              provides the state to its children. It will hold the "store" and
              be the parent of all the components that might need that store.
              Consumer as it so happens is a component that consumes and uses
              the state.

              useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is
              initialized to the passed argument ( initialValue ). The returned
              object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.
              Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value
              in its .current property.
